# Welcome to My Reactjs Calculator
My Reactjs Calculator

## Task
I had no problems with this project. just had a little trouble hosting the file in react js.

## Description
We have seen so far what React is and what it is capable of. To summarise in brief we got to know what React web-apps are, React Components, Props, States and lifecycle of a React component. 
We also created a basic clock application using all of the following. But React is a javascript library to build flexible User Interfaces, and we have not created any so far. 
So it is time for us to step into the real world of React by creating a simple yet impactful project.

## Installation
'npx create-react-app .'
'npm start' 
'npm build'

## Usage
I used css for javascript and styling

./my_project My React Calculator
